# cc-playerdata-to-https
Retrieve CozyCloud playerdata from an https endpoint:
<br>https://fjbpf3sb3r4dpjauqwzebltr2y0gsqxa.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws

This works by using AWS Lambda as a bridge between [cc-playerdata](https://github.com/ChickenSaysBak/cc-playerdata) (http only) and your app requiring https.
